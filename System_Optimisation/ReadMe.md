# System Optimisation
This repository contains all of the subsystem components combined. Please read all subsection README files for their specific requirements. The optimisation is run by running `Master_Code_Looped.m`.

## First Step
Before running the optimisation in `Master_Code_Looped.m` please run the python scripts outlined in Jacob_Submission. These will generate all of the neccessary datasheets to run this optimisation

## Master_Code_Looped
This master code should be used if looking for outside investment as it also considers returning their money, and profits, to them, whilst giving the community free sustainable energy

### Outputs
Running`Master_Code_Looped.m` will generate the following outputs:

_wind_turbine_profile_: the wind turbine profile which creates the optimal BESS WTG combination

_capacity_: The Capacity, in kWh, which creates the optimal BESS WTG combination

_optimal_Cost_: the cost of installing and maintaining the system over the 20 year period
