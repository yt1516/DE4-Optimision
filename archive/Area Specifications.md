# Village Case Study
This is taken from *Modellling and Optimization of Integrated Renewable Energy System for a Rural Site*. The whole paper can be found in the resource folder.
### Location
- Hilly remote village, electrification through IRES(Integrated Renewable Energy Systems).
- Difficult and uneconomical to electrify through grid connections. 
### Population
- 1500 in 300 households. 
- Most people are uneducated with main business as agriculture.
### Electrical Energy Consumption
- Agricultural, domestic, small scale industries and community.
- Main consuming appliances under domestic demands: *fan*, *television*, *compact fluorescent lamps*.
- Main consuming machines: *crop threshing machines*.
- Main community load: *schools*, *village panchayat offices*,
- Main industry load: *milk processing*

# Key figures and information
- Daily load profile by hour. This is more applicable to us.
- Seasonal/yearly load profile.
- Solar energy potential: *clearness index and solar radiation*
- Wind energy potential: *windspeed*. In the paper this was presented by Weibull distribution(basically a best filt line for their data).
