# Optimisation of hybrid renewable energy system using iterative filter selection approach
Link: https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.iclibezp1.cc.ic.ac.uk/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8049627 

## Notes

* A hybrid renewable system that yields **minimum total project cost** and **maximum reliability**, also **minimisation of unutilised surplus power**

* Current renewable energy sources: wind, solar, geothermal, biomass and hydropower. Main issue is reliability as highly dependent on nature and weather conditions.
