## Notes
* **Photovoltaic system**:  
   I(T)=I(Direct)R(Direct) + I(Diffuse)R(Diffuse) + R(Reflected) * (I(Direct) + I(Diffuse))  
   where I(Direct) and I(Diffuse) are direct adn diffuse solar radiations  
   R(Diffuse) and R(Reflected) are tilt factors for diffuse and reflected part of the solar radiaions.  
   More info from: Duffie and Beckman "Solar Engineering of thermal processes" 1991 
* **Wind Energy system**:  
   P(w) = 1/2 * p(a) * A * C(p) * v^3  
   where P(w) is power output, p(a) is air density, A is swept area, C(p) is power coefficient, and v is wind speed
* **Biomass**:  
   PBM = VBM * CV * t  
   where PBM is power output, VBM is volume of gas, CV is calorific value, and t is time
## This paper is very similar to our initial idea
