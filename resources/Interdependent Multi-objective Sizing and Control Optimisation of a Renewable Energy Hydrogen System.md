# Interdependent Multi-objective Sizing and Control Optimisation of a Renewable Energy Hydrogen System

## Notes
* The system consist of a wind turbine generator, photovoltaic generators, a PEM electrolyser, and LAB storage.
* F(x) = {f1(x),...,fk(x)}. F(x) is the set of K objective functions, x represents the n-dimensional decision variable vector. Decision variables are restricted by upper and lower bound values. The objective is to find a vector x* in the solution space that optimises the K objective functions.
* Wind speed and irradiation data are key. Both can be found as statistical distributions.  
   Bendt et al. (1981) had an average monthly clearness index, which can determine hourly irradiation on a tilted surface.  
   Clearness index is the relationship between terrestrail and extraterrestrial radiation. Duffie and Beckman (1991) calculated extraterrestrial radiation.  
   Wind distributions use Weibull distribution function, Borowy and Salameh (1994)
