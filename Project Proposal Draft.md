# Problem statement
Profit optimisation for a renewable energy company specialised in wind turbine farm and electricity storage and distribution.
## System design problem
Current optimisation methods for renewable energy applications are mostly focusing on energy production and cost reduction. There is little information on optimised strategies of buying and selling energy based on supply and demond of the area with respect to weather conditions. This study will describe an optimised strategy for most profitable energy distribution system for a given area. 
## Anticipated trade-offs
Initial cost plays a huge role in this application. Assuming the return is linear(not considering risk), smaller initial cost corresponds to shorter payback period but less ROI after break even. 
## Previous work 
Lots of research done on an optimised design of wind turbine blade for different objectives, i.e. mass, efficiency, lifespan, installation methods etc. Also research done on wind farm layout and battery storage units, with most focused on building cost, maintenance cost, reliability and efficiency. 

# System Decomposition
## Wind turbine blades
Optimisation of individual turbine blades using FEA.
## Wind turbine farm
Optimisation of allocation of the turbines, installation costs, and power generation.
## Battery storage units
Optimisation of electric energy storage units. Optimise for costs while meeting the capacity requirement.
## Control system
Optimisation of electricity flow. Optimise for profit while meeting the load requirement.
