## Wind Turbine

Optimisation for wind turbines (WT) is a great option. There are lots of research done already and all the functions of calculating the physical parameters are widely available. 

### Objectives

- Maximise *annual energy production*. 
- Maximise *profit*. Could further divide into short term profit or long term profit. This may include minimising installation cost and/or maintenance cost, power production, power storage etc. 
- Minimise *total cost*. This may include initial cost and maintenance cost. Or could be total cost of an area covered by WT given wind speed, power output requirement etc.
- Minimise *weight*. Weight relates to cost. This is more applicable to remote, harsh environments, i.e. in the ocean, on a roof.
